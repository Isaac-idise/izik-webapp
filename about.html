        <h2>Who is Isaac ?</h2>
        <p>
         To be honest Isaac is just like you but he's only slightly different in the sense that at his core, He's always hungered for something more. He's just someone who decided he wanted more out of life. More growth, more purpose, more meaning. He didn’t want to just exist—He wanted to become something greater, to push beyond his limits, and to live fully in the person God created him to be.<br><br>

I believe in consistency because I know that real change doesn’t happen overnight. It’s the small, intentional steps that shape who we are. I believe in faith because, without God, I am nothing. And I believe in discipline because dreams don’t chase themselves.

I’m not perfect, but I’m committed. To learning, to growing, to becoming better every single day. The journey is just beginning, and I’m all in.
        </p>
        <h2>Appreciation</h2>
        <p>As I enter into my new age, I just want to thank God for where he is taking me and for all that he's done in my life,I am grateful for where I am going in my tech journey, and I am sure gonna make my family proud.</p>
